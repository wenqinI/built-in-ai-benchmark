There is a table, which contains three drawers: left drawer, middle drawer and right drawer; Tom Ethan, Elbert Alex, Jack Johnson, and Mario Thompson all saw a bag of chocolates on the table. Tom Ethan asked Elbert Alex and Jack Johnson to go out, and after that, he put the bag of chocolates in the right drawer in front of Mario Thompson; after Jack Johnson came back, Tom Ethan asked Mario Thompson to go out to find Elbert Alex, and took it from the left drawer in front of Jack Johnson. Then He take out a box of biscuits and put them in the middle drawer; when Elbert Alex and Mario Thompson returned, Tom Ethan asked Jack Johnson and Mario Thompson to go out to buy a bottle of soy sauce. Tom Ethan waited for a long time, and found that Jack Johnson and Mario Thompson had not returned, so he sent Elbert Alex to look for them, but in the end only Jack Johnson and Elbert Alex came back. Jack Johnson told Tom Ethan that at first they could not find any shop that is providing soy sauce, so they had to separate to search other shops, which is why Mario Thompson got lost; on the way back, Jack Johnson ran into Elbert Alex, and they rushed back first. Therefore, Tom Ethan asked them to go out to find Mario Thompson again; in order to prevent getting lost again, Tom Ethan told Elbert Alex and Jack Johnson to walk together at all time, and even if they could not get the soy sauce, they had to find and get back with Mario Thompson. As a result, Elbert Alex and Jack Johnson found Mario Thompson outside and found that he had bought a bottle of soy sauce. The three felt that Tom Ethan never went out to do anything but they are busy all the time. So they were very angry. They discussed and made a conclusion. After going back to see Tom Ethan, they should not tell him about the soy sauce they bought, and asked Jack Johnson to hide the soy sauce in his backpack. After the three of them came back together, they pretended to claim that they did not find and buy soy sauce according to the plan, and hoped that Tom Ethan would go out together to buy things in the future, and he should not be so lazy. Tom Ethan agreed and felt sorry about that. When everyone finally stood in front of the table, the four of them wrote down the list of items they knew and the location of the items. So the question is: is the information written by these four people consistent, and why?
